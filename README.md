## Notebook Contents

The Jupyter Notebook follows a systematic approach to analyze the given advertising data:
1. **Calculation of Conversion Cost**: Derive the conversion cost for each campaign by dividing total expenses by the number of conversions.
2. **Campaign Aggregation**: Aggregate and filter data based on campaigns and their costs.
3. **Comparative Analysis**: Compare campaigns with varying costs and conversion rates to identify distinctive features.
4. **Dependencies Analysis**: Analyze the relationship between conversion and various factors like keywords and conditions.
5. **Prediction Model**: Develop a model to predict conversions based on campaign characteristics.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The project is implemented using Python.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive data analysis and visualizations.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **SciPy**: For conducting statistical tests to validate the findings in the analysis.
